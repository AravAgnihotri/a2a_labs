Master Prompt for Replit: A2A Agent Dashboard
Project Overview
Build a comprehensive dashboard for an Agent-to-Agent (A2A) coordination platform. This is the control center where users manage their AI agents, visualize agent-to-agent interactions in real-time, and access a marketplace of pre-built agent templates.

Core Requirements
1. DASHBOARD HOME - Agent Management Interface
Layout:

Left sidebar: Navigation (Dashboard, My Agents, Marketplace, AI Builder, Settings)
Main content area: Agent cards in a grid layout
Top bar: Search, notifications, user profile

Agent Cards Display:
Each agent card should show:

Agent name and icon/avatar
Status indicator (● Active / ○ Paused / ⚠ Error)
Key metrics today:

Messages sent/received
Tasks completed
Last action timestamp


Quick action buttons: [View Details] [Pause/Resume] [Settings] [Delete]

Example card:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🤖 Job Application Agent            │
│ Status: ● Active                    │
│                                     │
│ Today's Activity:                   │
│ • 47 messages sent                  │
│ • 12 jobs applied                   │
│ • Last action: 5 min ago            │
│                                     │
│ [View Tree] [Pause] [Settings]      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
Features:

Drag and drop to reorder agents
Bulk actions (pause all, resume all)
Filter by status, type, or tags
Real-time updates (WebSocket or polling)


2. TREE DIAGRAM VIEW (n8n-style visualization)
CRITICAL FEATURE - This is the killer differentiator
When user clicks "View Tree" on any agent, show a visual workflow diagram of agent-to-agent interactions.
Layout:

Full-screen modal or dedicated page
Canvas area for the tree diagram
Side panel: Message logs and details
Top controls: [Pause] [Resume] [Retry Failed] [Export Logs]

Tree Diagram Requirements:
Visual Structure:
[Your Agent]
    ├──→ [LinkedIn Agent] ✓ Success
    │        └── Found 47 job postings (2 min ago)
    │
    ├──→ [Web Scraper Agent] ✓ Success  
    │        └── Scraped 47 pages (1 min ago)
    │
    ├──→ [Research Agent] ⏳ In Progress (32/47)
    │        ├── Researching company culture
    │        └── Estimated: 5 min remaining
    │
    └──→ [Email Agent] ⏸ Waiting
             └── Ready to send applications

Realistic timestamps
Sample data payloads


Key Features Priority
MUST HAVE (MVP):

✅ Agent dashboard (list, cards, basic controls)
✅ Tree diagram visualization (this is THE killer feature)
✅ Message logs (side panel)
✅ Agent pause/resume
✅ Basic marketplace (browse, view templates)

SHOULD HAVE (Phase 2):

AI Builder (natural language → agent)
Purchase flow (buy templates)
Real-time updates (WebSocket)
Settings page
Analytics/metrics

NICE TO HAVE (Phase 3):

Multi-model support in AI Builder
Advanced filters and search
Team collaboration features
Export/import agents
Webhook integrations


Performance Requirements

Initial page load: < 2 seconds
Tree diagram render: < 500ms for 50 nodes
Real-time updates: < 100ms latency
Search: < 200ms response time
Mobile responsive: All features work on mobile


Success Metrics to Display
Dashboard Overview:

Total agents created
Messages sent today/this week
Active agents
Success rate (%)
Cost today/this month

Per-Agent Metrics:

Uptime (%)
Messages sent/received
Average response time
Success/failure rate
Cost per action

Marketplace Metrics:

Template popularity (downloads)
Rating distribution
Revenue (if seller)


Additional Notes
Design Philosophy:

Make agents VISIBLE (tree diagram is key)
Make coordination TRANSPARENT (show all messages)
Make management EASY (visual controls, not code)
Make onboarding FAST (marketplace templates, AI builder)

User Mental Model:

Agents are like team members
Dashboard is the team management tool
Tree diagram shows who's talking to whom
Marketplace is the hiring platform
AI Builder is the training/onboarding system

The Goal:
Create a dashboard that makes users say "Wow, I can SEE my agents working together!" The tree diagram is the star of the show. Everything else supports it.

Build Instructions for Replit

Start with a Next.js + TypeScript template
Install dependencies: react-flow-renderer, recharts, tailwindcss
Create the folder structure:

/components (agent cards, tree diagram, marketplace)
/pages (dashboard, agent-detail, marketplace, ai-builder)
/lib (API calls, utilities)
/hooks (custom React hooks)
/types (TypeScript interfaces)


Build components in this order:

AgentCard component
Dashboard page (grid of cards)
TreeDiagram component (React Flow)
AgentDetailPage (includes tree diagram)
Marketplace page
AI Builder page


Use mock data initially (JSON files)
Add real-time updates last (WebSocket)

Start with the tree diagram - that's the most important feature. Get that working perfectly before anything else.

Final Checklist

 Dashboard shows agent cards in grid
 Click agent opens tree diagram view
 Tree diagram shows agent-to-agent interactions
 Real-time status updates (color changes)
 Message log side panel works
 Marketplace displays templates
 Template cards are clickable
 AI Builder has chat interface
 Settings page exists
 Mobile responsive
 Dark mode support
 Loading states everywhere
 Error handling everywhere

Remember: The tree diagram is the CORE innovation. Make it beautiful, intuitive, and real-time. That's what will make users say "I need this."Claude is AI and can make mistakes. Please double-check responses. Sonnet 4.5Claude is AI and can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
