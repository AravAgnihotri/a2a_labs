Replit Prompt — Post-Sign-In Minimal Onboarding

Build a post-sign-in onboarding flow for a modern agent-coordination platform.

This onboarding starts only after the user has successfully signed in (account already created).

The goal is to:

Collect high-signal user context

Establish identity and username

Create a calm, premium first experience

Gate access to the product until onboarding is complete

Core Rules

User signs in first (email + password)

Immediately after sign-in, redirect into onboarding

Users cannot access the dashboard or any product feature until onboarding is completed

If onboarding is incomplete, always redirect the user back into onboarding on future logins

Onboarding Experience

Multi-step flow (8–9 steps)

One question per screen

Minimal copy

UX & Design Requirements

Minimalist layout

Neutral colors

Generous spacing

No icons unless necessary

No emojis

Subtle animations only

Disabled actions until valid input

No modals

This should feel closer to Linear, Stripe, or Vercel than a consumer app.

Data & Logic Requirements

All onboarding answers stored on the user profile

Username uniqueness enforced at database level

Handle race conditions correctly

Onboarding completion flag checked on every login

Explicit Non-Goals

No pricing

No upsells

No tutorials

No feature explanations

No dashboard elements during onboarding

Final Instruction

This onboarding happens after sign-in, not before.
It is designed for clarity, trust, and long-term product personalization.

Treat this as a production-grade system, not a demo.
